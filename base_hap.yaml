# HAP (HomeKit) enabled base configuration for RATGDO
# This extends the base configuration with HomeKit Accessory Protocol support
# Requires ESP32 (ESP8266 not supported by HAP-ESPHome)
#
# IMPORTANT: This configuration uses the "Production Ready" commit from HAP-ESPHome
# (910e053b) that was marked as stable for garage door opener integration.
# This commit predates the API compatibility issues introduced in later commits:
# - Maintains proper hap_char_get_val() API usage
# - Avoids HAP_VAL_TYPE_INVALID compatibility issues  
# - Includes proper header dependencies and type definitions
